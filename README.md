## What I Learned

During the development of "Feedback UI," I gained valuable insights and learned several key concepts and skills:

- **React.js Proficiency**: This project provided an opportunity to strengthen my proficiency in React.js, mastering the core concepts of component-based development and state management.

- **Context API**: I learned how to effectively utilize React's Context API for efficient state management, enabling seamless data sharing and synchronization across components.

- **Icon Integration**: Integrating React Icons enhanced the visual appeal and interactivity of the user interface, adding a dynamic touch to the feedback experience.

- **Routing with React Router DOM**: I explored and implemented smooth navigation and routing within the application using React Router DOM, creating a seamless user journey.

- **Mock REST API with json-server**: The use of json-server to simulate a REST API for data posting, updating, and deleting was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to interact with data in a controlled environment.

- **CSS Styling and Responsiveness**: I honed my skills in CSS styling and responsiveness, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design across various devices.

These learnings have enriched my development skills and will undoubtedly contribute to the success of future projects.
